You can start creating your own passes by passing few configurable items and images. Requires P12 & WWDR certificates and a Pass Type ID. See requesting certificates section for more information. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* PHP 5.3+\r\n* [zip](http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php)\r\n* [OpenSSL](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php)\r\n\r\n## Requesting Certificates\r\n\r\n### P12 Certificate & Pass Type ID\r\n1. Logon to [iOS Provisioning portal](https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/passtypeids/index.action \"iOS Provisioning portal\") and click on Pass Type IDs\r\n2. Follow the instructions to create a Pass Type ID\r\n3. Once you have created, click on configure and download the .cer file\r\n4. Add downloaded file to your Keychain Access simply by clicking\r\n5. Locate the certificate in Keychain Access and select Export pass in right click menu\r\n6. Enter a password and save the P12 certifacate somewhere that the library can reach\r\n\r\nNote down also your Pass Type ID. You will find it above download button in the following format:\r\n\r\nABC123ABC1.pass.com.your-company.id\r\n\r\nThe part starting with pass.com is your teamIdentifier and first 10 characters are passTypeIdentifier\r\n\r\n### WWDR Certificate\r\nAppleâ€™s World Wide Developer Relations (WWDR) certificate is available from Apple at <http://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cer>. Download and install the certificate so that you can use it to certify builds. The WWDR certificate links your development certificate to Apple, completing the trust chain for your application.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nYou can see [doc/demo](https://github.com/eymengunay/php-passbook/tree/master/doc/demo \"doc/demo\") folder for example code. You will need to fill in required fields (certificates and ids) in order to generate a pass successfully.\r\n","google":""}
